How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it easy to compare, so instead of having to open the files side by side and go line by line it brought up the difference on its own.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Making mistakes are not as bad.  Mistakes make you better as a programmer.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro - dont have to think to do it
    con - commit at an akward or wierd moment in coding

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git seems to be coding oriented, users are known to work on multiple files at once, Google Docs typically focuses on just using one document at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    can see different commits (changes) that were done for each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   much easier to experiment knowing that reverting to a previous version is simple.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
